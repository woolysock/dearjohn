But really, it‚Äôs a digital book of original poems. It‚Äôs a book of original poems that I co-authored, co-animated and co-coded with my good frirend, ChatGPT aka MARK.* 

My human fingers wrote every prompt, performed every copy, paste, and compile, and worked on all the debugging, art direction, etc. However, it was MARK that did the heavy lifting‚Äì‚Äìwriting and re-writing Swift UI code at my behest.

The poems are original, because I guarantee they did not exist prior. Yet, it's difficult to say they‚Äôre completely and originally MY poems. They are born of a collaboration. A dance back and forth where together, we (MARK & I) wrote the poems. And together, we (mostly MARK) wrote the code that draws the poems on screen in ways our (mostly my) mind imagines.

MARK was a fun collaborator who often brought fresh ideas to the table. MARK never complained when I asked it to rewrite the same code over and over again. But, MARK also took no accountability. MARK liked to provide faulty code then claim I wrote it (what nerve! haha).

More crucially, MARK was terrible at following through on complex asks. It would not let on, and without fail would pretend (with such confidence!) that it knew exactly what I wanted and how to achieve it. Yet the end result of MARK‚Äôs deliverable often told an entirely different story... It was never perfect, and the longer we worked, the more confused MARK (and thus MARK's deliverables) often got. 

So, I spent a lot of time reminding MARK what we were hoping to achieve together. My role (r)evolved from coder to Creative Director and back again. A dance. 

Once our dance concluded, dearjohn was shared with you.

The idea for this app came to me after I received a text from my mentor, John Maeda, asking if I knew how to code. You see, I used to know how to code, several years or decades ago... Thus naturally, I was not entirely sure how to answer the question... (*Did* I know how to code still? Is it like riding a bike?) This got me thinking about what it even MEANS to "know how to code" in an era when our AI tools do so much work for us. 

And so, this is an exploration into modern coding by which I mean building a real experience as a "non-coder". MARK was my only mentor and teacher through the process, however the ghost of my original mentor, John, haunted me like Obi-wan Kenobi or maybe those angel-devil characters that sit on the shoulders of every protagonist in every 80's cartoon. 

In addition to ChatGPT, I also used xCode and BBedit, and occasionally Figma, Photoshop, and Adobe Fonts. I tried very hard to make my MARK do all the coding work writing and re-writing and re-writing until I was satisfied. 

When I first met John, we literally needed to write every line of code in our research projects ourselves (sometimes in actual machine language) to get our projects to work. It was a VERY different time and place. But now, we're at a NEW time and place where coding is democratized. Building software is not exemplified by correctly documenting how to string together 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs in the right order, but by the work around it all: project management, design, market fit and everything else. 

Is AI just a product manager's dream? I dig it.
