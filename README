# dear john,

**A digital poetry app… nothing more, yet everything more.**

An iOS art project exploring what it means to create in an age of artificial intelligence.

## About

*dear john,* is a small digital book containing three original poems, jointly written by a human (me) and AI. Each poem questions a different component of the essence of creation in a world where our closest collaborators are machines.

This app was born from a simple question: "Can you still code?" 

The answer became this—a love letter to my mentor, a meditation on creation, and a conversation starter about the future of development.

## What's Inside

- **Three interactive poems** that explore:
  - *what* — the essence of creation
  - *who* — who creates, really?
  - *why* — why create code vs ideas?
  
- **Gesture-based interactions** — tap, swipe, shake your way through
- **Original animations** — bringing poetry to life
- **A collaboration** — human ideas meets AI execution

## The Story

This project is about:
- Getting back to coding after years away
- Embracing AI as a collaborator, not a replacement
- Questioning what value humans provide when machines can write code
- Creating something beautiful and thought-provoking

## Built With

- **Xcode** — iOS development
- **Swift** — primary language
- **ChatGPT (MARK)** — AI collaborator for code generation and iteration
- **Adobe Photoshop & Figma** — visual design
- **Claude** — additional AI assistance

## Philosophy

> "Is skill being removed—or just shifting up, to a new abstraction layer?"

This app is literature. This app is art. 

But more importantly, it's intended to make you smile and spark interesting conversations about creativity, authorship, and the future of making things.

## Dedicated To

My mentor: For pushing me to create beauty through code, as they always do.
